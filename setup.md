## Install LaTeX

LaTeX is composed of many softwares working together. In order to use them easily, *distributions* exist : they combine all the needed tools in one big package. To work on your LaTeX source files, you will need to install a distribution and an editor. 

Please install LaTeX before the course starts, so that we can directly dive into LaTeX during the course.

### Install LaTeX for Windows

There 2 steps :

1. We recommend that you download and install the windows texlive version(install-tl-windows.exe) <https://tug.org/texlive/acquire-netinstall.html>. This is the distribution we will use during the class.

2. Please also install a LaTeX editor : we suggest that you use the texmaker gui <https://www.xm1math.net/texmaker>. We will use this editor in class. There are other editors that could suit your needs. 

### Install LaTeX for MacOS

<p>LaTeX is a typesetting system, you can use it for writing articles, books, thesis or any kind of writing document.</p>

<p>It integrates a lot of useful tools for managing figures, tables, table of contents, equation etc.</p>

<p>Latex is ideal because it generates beautiful documents easily.</p>

<h2 id="how-it-works">How it works</h2>

<p>Latex is different from a what-you-see-is-what-you-get software like Microsoft Word, because you can’t see how the document will look like immediately : before it has been processed by the Latex software, this process is called <strong>compilation</strong>.</p>

<p>The compilation transforms your text source into a PDF document, distributing text across lines and pages, composing paragraphs, building tables, generating formulas, inserting images, keeping of track of numbering and references, etc.</p>

<p>As author you edit a source file which is just a simple text file, containing your text along with formatting commands. Those commands will be read during the compilation and will lead to the final document.</p>

<h2 id="who-does-what">Who does what</h2>

<p>As author, you produce content meaning you focus on the text—and only the text!—while issuing formatting instructions to express your intention by defining the role and function of each part of text.</p>

<p>The compilation is in charge of the layout. It will translate your intentions into graphical design using pre-established style sheets and adhering to typographical conventions.</p>

<h2 id="why-its-nice-">Why it’s nice ?</h2>
<p>By separating the content (the text and the formating) from the form (how it will look like) Latex has a lot of nice feature that are hard to beat :</p>

<ul>
  <li>The document will always looks nice, because the pre-established style are designed to be functional and readable</li>
  <li>It can manage huge document, because the pictures and other huge file are not loaded when you type</li>
  <li>You can manage easily citation, references, tables of contents</li>
  <li>You can easily change the style of your document, for example if you decide at some point to change the font size of the title, it will take you 2 seconds to do it</li>
  <li>You can write nice equations</li>
</ul>

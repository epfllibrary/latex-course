Overleaf is a web platform where you can write LaTeX and compile documents easily. Packages, environments and commands should work the same in Overleaf as in locally installed versions of LaTeX. 

Note : EPFL members have access to the premium version of [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com ) if they sign up with their EPFL email address.
